# AngularDataTable

Website: https://easoroysan.github.io/angular-data-table/

This is just a small showcase of angular. I have a table that can adapt to many screen sizes. Users can add, edit, and delete data, as well as undo changes through the snackbar. All changes are purely frontend for this project.
